## Text Analysis Utility Language (TAUL)
TAUL is a language/library which aims to provide the capabilities of a parser generator with the conveniences of a scripting language.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/TirousCoded/TAUL.git`.

TAUL has *no external dependencies, btw.*

Next, use TAUL's *build system* [premake](https://premake.github.io/) to build the solution.

## Reference Material

TAUL reference material is based around the idea of the end-user using the docs provided in the `docs/` part of the repo,
alongside reading the documentation comments in `*.h` header files of the TAUL frontend.

To this end, view `taul/all.h` as a kind of *table of contents* in regards to the ladder.

Finally, in `examples/` there's some example code for basic usage of the core functionality of the frontend.
