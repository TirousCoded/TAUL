#       which MAYBE we could instead make merely a semantic error


lexer section:

    # token, failure, and PPR name PPR0, are semantically illegal in LPR,
    # but may syntactically be put there

    LPR0            : begin end any 'abc' [abc] token failure LPR0 PPR0 ;

parser section:

    # charset is illegal in PPR, but may syntactically be put there

    PPR0            : begin end any 'abc' [abc] token failure LPR0 PPR0 ;
